# My emacs configuration

## History

I am using emacs since the late 1990s. My old emacs configuration actually
dates back to then. It became difficult to maintain and it so it became harder
and harder to catch up with the recent developments in and around emacs.

So I recently started rewriting it from scratch. I took ideas and snippets from
the video series [Emacs From
Scratch](https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/.)


## Focused tasks

At first I used emacs mainly to write scientific texts, so important packages I
used where auctex, reftex, etc. Nowadays my focus shifted more in the realm of
programming. So the configuration now focuses more on programming language
modes, ~lsp-mode~ eglot, ~dap-mode~, etc.

The languages I am using mainly are python, Rust, elixir, SQL, C, C++,
javascript/typescript.

It also makes heavy use of modern helpers like consult, embark, vertico, corfu
and the like.

At the moment I don't have any LaTeX packages in my configuration, as it has
been a long time since I have actually been using LaTeX. So I decided not to
transfer the old configuration into my new one. I would rather set up a new
LaTeX configuration from scratch, as soon as I need LaTeX again.

Feel free to take ideas, snippets or use the whole thing. I would recommend to
setup your own hand crafted configuration.
